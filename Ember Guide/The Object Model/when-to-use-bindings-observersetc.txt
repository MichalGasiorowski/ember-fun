// Bindings, Observers, Computed Properties: What Do I Use When? 
// 1. Use computed properties to build a new 
// property by synthesizing other properties. Computed properties should 
// not contain app behaviour, nor cause any side-effects. Multiple calls
// to computed property should, almost always return same value
// 2. Observers should contain behaviour that reacts to changes in another property. 
// Observers are especially useful when you need to perform some behaviour 
// after binding has finished synchronizing
// 3. Bindings are most often used to ensure objects in 2 different 
// layers are always in sync. Ex: bind your views to your controller using Handlebars.
